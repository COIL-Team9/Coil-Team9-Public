## Project Topic
The topic for this project will be predicting a film's revenue based on release data and
genre. The project will include a webpage where the user can input fields like movie title,
genres, release data, budget, director, cast members, production company, and movie length.
The backend would then perform calculations, based on exisiting movie datasets, to predict
the film's expected revenue. The predicted revenue will be displayed on the webpage.
